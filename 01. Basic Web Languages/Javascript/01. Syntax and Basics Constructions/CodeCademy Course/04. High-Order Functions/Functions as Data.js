// In JavaScript, functions are first class objects. 
// This means that, like other objects youâ€™ve encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods.

// Since functions are a type of object, they have properties such as .length and .name and methods such as .toString(). 

// Functions are special because we can invoke them, but we can still treat them like any other type of data.
