<h1 align="center">Welcome to my FrontEnd Roadmap Study Notebook ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## What is this?

FrontEnd Roadmap Study is my repository and notebook from all my studies as a FrontEnd Developer.
I divided it into folders according to the study diagram below. In each folder you can see a README.md with notes for that topic, along with exercises and all the material created for learning.
Every year the diagram is updated and I re-study it again.
