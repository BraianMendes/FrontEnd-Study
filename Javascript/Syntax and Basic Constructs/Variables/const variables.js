// The const keyword was introduced in ES6, and is short for the word constant. Just like with var and let you can store any value in a const variable. The way you declare a const variable and assign a value to it follows the same structure as let and var. 
// However, a const variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant. If you try to reassign a const variable, you’ll get a TypeError.
// Constant variables must be assigned a value when declared. If you try to declare a const variable without a value, you’ll get a SyntaxError.
